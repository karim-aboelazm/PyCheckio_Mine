  — Listen, even the smallest warrior can make an army so much more powerful if he’s in a right place. And even the strongest one can weaken the whole formation if he stands in the wrong rank.

 Your mission here is to find a difference between the maximally positive and maximally negative numbers. Those numbers can be found by concatenating the given array of numbers.
</p>
<p>
 Let’s check an example. If you have numbers 1,2,3, then 321 is the maximum number, and 123 - is the minimum. The difference between those numbers is 198. But if you have numbers 4, 3 and 12 then 4312 is the maximum number, and 1234 - is the minimum. As you can see, a simple order is not what we are looking for here.

   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 
 <pre class="brush: python">bigger_together([1,2,3,4]) == 3087 # 4321 - 1234
bigger_together([1,2,3,4, 11, 12]) == 32099877 # 43212111 - 11112234
bigger_together([0, 1]) == 9 # 10 - 01
bigger_together([100]) == 0 # 100 - 100</pre>
 
</div>

 <strong>
  Precondition:

 <i>
  All elements of the list can't be less than 0
