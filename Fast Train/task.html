<h2>Fast Train</h2>
<p>
 You are planning the train schedule and you want to know the minimum time of traveling between the stations.
</p>
<p>
 Each section of the rail between stations is given in the list.
Each section is a tuple of distance and speed limit (both are integers).
You can change the speed ( +1. -1 and ± 0 ) at the start and every minute after that.
The train runs by the same amount as the speed value in a minute.
 <br/>
 Note: This means that a train with a speed 2 will travel a distance 2 before another minute passes and its speed can be changed again.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Starting speed is 0.
 </li>
 <li>
  Speed limit is set for each section of the rail.
        You don't exceed it.
 </li>
 <li>
  You must reach the target station at speed 1 (because it’s necessary to stop at the station).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.

   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 
 <pre class="brush: python">
fast_train([(4, 3)]) == 3 # (1, 2, 1)
fast_train([(9, 5)]) == 5 # (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)
fast_train([(5, 5), (4, 2)]) == 6 # e.g. (1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 
A list of the section of the rail. Each section is a tuple of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer). 

</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 For efficient acceleration and deceleration.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   distance &gt; 0
  </li>
  <li>
   speed limit &gt; 0
  </li>
  <li>
   len(section) &gt; 0
  </li>
 </ul>
