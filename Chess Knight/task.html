<h2>Chess Knight</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 Your friend loves chess very much, but he's not a strong player. You can help him by using your programming skills.
 <br/>
 If this mission is too simple for you, try another one from this set -
 <a href="https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/shortest-knight-path/">
  The shortest Knight's path
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Your task is to write a function that can find all of the chessboard cells to which the Knight can move. The input data will consist of a start cell and the amount of moves that the Knight will make. There is only one figure on the board - your Knight.
 <br/>
 If the same cell appears more than once - do not add it again.
You should return the list of all of the possible cells and sort them as follows:
in alphabetical order (from 'a' to 'h') and in ascending order (from 'a1' to 'a8' and so on).
