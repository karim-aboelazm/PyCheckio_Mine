  "[The Euclidean algorithm] is the granddaddy of all algorithms, because it is the oldest nontrivial algorithm
        that has survived to the present day."

  The greatest common divisor
 </a>
 (GCD), also known as
    the greatest common factor of two or more integers (at least one of which is not zero), is the largest positive
    integer that divides a number without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
</p>
<p>
 You are given an arbitrary number of positive integers.
    You should find the greatest common divisor for these numbers.
