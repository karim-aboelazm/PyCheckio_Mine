<h2>The Einstein Problem-Lite</h2>

  The Einstein's Puzzle
 </a>
 is a well-known logic puzzle.
    It is often called Einstein's Puzzle because it is said to have been invented by Albert Einstein as a boy.
    However, there is no known evidence for Einstein's or Carroll's authorship.
    This puzzle can be modified with various conditions to produce a variety of similar puzzles. For starters, we will
    solve a simplified version of the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
 There are 5 houses on street which are painted 5 different colors:
 <b>
  blue
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  green
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  red
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  white
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  yellow
 </b>
 .
 <br/>
 In each house lives a person of a different nationality:
 <b>
  Brit
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  Dane
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  German
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  Norwegian
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  Swede
 </b>
 .
 <br/>
 These people drink a certain beverage:
 <b>
  beer
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  coffee
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  milk
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  tea
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  water
 </b>
 .
 <br/>
 Smoke a certain brand of cigarettes:
 <b>
  Rothmans
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  Dunhill
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  PallMall
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  Winfield
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  Marlboro
 </b>
 .
 <br/>
 They keep a certain pet:
 <b>
  cat
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  bird
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  dog
 </b>
 ,
 <b>
  fish
 </b>
 and
 <b>
  horse
 </b>
 .
</p>
<p>
 None of the owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigarette, or drink the same beverage.
</p>
<p>
 You are given a set of "relations". Each relation connects two identifiers in the owner relationships. For example:
    "Norwegian-Dunhill" indicates that the Norwegian smokes only Dunhill. "5-dog" indicates that the owner of the 5th
    house also owns a dog. Similar to Einstein's version of the problem, we will use only these types of relations.
</p>
<p>
 The second argument is a question which you need to answer. The question is represented as two words separated by
    dash. The first word is a characteristic of the owner while the second is a characteristic (
 <strong>
  number,
    color,nationality, beverage, cigarettes or pet
 </strong>
 ) you need to determine based on the first characteristic. For
    example: "horse-cigarettes" asks"What the cigarettes do the owner of the horse smoke?" or "green-number" asks "What
    is the street number of the green house?".
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two arguments. Relations as a tuple of strings and a question as a string.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The answer as a string.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 This mission teaches you something about constraint satisfaction problems within the classic context of an Einstein riddle.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 All questions have only one possible answer.
